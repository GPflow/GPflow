Getting Started
===============

This section aims to give you the knowledge necessary to use GPflow on small-to-medium projects,
without necessarily going too much into the mathematical and technical details. We do not try to
teach the theory behind Gaussian Processes. If you need a deeper understanding of the technical
details or advanced features of GPflow please see our `User Guide`_.

We will assume you are reasonably familiar with Python, NumPy and maybe TensorFlow, and it is good
if you have some previous experience with data processing or machine learning in Python. We do not
assume prior knowldege of Gaussian Processes.
