GPflow
======

GPflow is a package for building Gaussian Process models in python, using `TensorFlow
<http://www.tensorflow.org>`_. Gaussian Processes are a kind of supervised learning models.
Some advantages of Gaussian Processes are:

* Uncertainty is an inherent part of Gaussian Processes. A Gaussian Process can tell you when
  it does not know the answer.
* Works well with small datasets. If your data is limited Gaussian Procceses can get the most from
  your data.
* Can scale to large datasets. Although Gaussian Processes, admittedly, can be computationally
  intensive there are ways to scale them to large datasets.

GPflow was originally created by `James Hensman <http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/hensmanj/>`_
and `Alexander G. de G. Matthews <http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/?portfolio=alex-matthews>`_.
Today it is primarily maintained by the company `Secondmind <https://www.secondmind.ai/>`_.

Since the publication of the GPflow paper, the software has been significantly extended
with the framework for interdomain approximations and multioutput priors. We review the
framework and describe the design in :cite:t:`GPflow2020multioutput`, which can be cited by users:
