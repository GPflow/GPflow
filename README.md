[Glossary](GLOSSARY.md)

GPflow is a package for building Gaussian process models in python, using [TensorFlow](http://www.tensorflow.org). It was originally created and is now managed by [James Hensman](http://jameshensman.github.io/) and [Alexander G. de G. Matthews](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/?portfolio=alex-matthews).
The full list of [contributors](http://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/graphs/contributors) (in alphabetical order) is

## What does GPflow do?

GPflow implements modern Gaussian process inference for composable kernels and likelihoods. The [online documentation (develop)](http://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/develop/)/[(master)](http://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/master/) contains more details.

GPflow 2.0 uses [TensorFlow 2.0](http://www.tensorflow.org) for running computations, which allows fast execution on GPUs, and uses Python â‰¥ 3.6.


## Install GPflow 2

- From source

  With the release of _TensorFlow_ 2.1 and _Tensorflow Probability_ 0.9, you should
  only need to run

  ```bash
  pip install -e .
  ```

  in a check-out of the `develop` branch of the GPflow github repository.

- Using `pip`:

  - latest `develop` version:
    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow.git@develop#egg=gpflow
    ```
    (this will automatically install all required dependencies).

  - latest PyPI package: currently not recommended
    (the latest version released on PyPI is 2.0.0rc1; this release candidate is missing several bugfixes and improvements, and does not support _TensorFlow_ 2.1)
    but you can install it as follows:
    ```bash
    pip install gpflow==2.0.0rc1 tensorflow==2.0 tensorflow_probability==0.8
    ```
    (replace `tensorflow==2.0` with `tensorflow-gpu==2.0` for the GPU version)

## Install GPflow 1.5.1 (last official release)

Using `pip`:
```bash
pip install 'gpflow<2.0' 'tensorflow<2.0'
```
GPflow leaves installing tensorflow to the user so that you can choose whether you want the CPU-only or the GPU-support package. Replace `tensorflow<2.0` with `tensorflow-gpu<2.0` for the GPU version.


## Getting Started with GPflow 2.0

There is an ["Intro to GPflow 2.0"](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/blob/develop/doc/source/notebooks/intro_to_gpflow2.ipynb) Jupyter notebook; check it out for details. To convert your code from GPflow 1 check the [GPflow 2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/blob/develop/doc/source/notebooks/gpflow_2_upgrade/gpflow2_upgrade_guide.ipynb).

- **GPflow 1.0**

  *We have stopped development and support for GPflow based on TensorFlow 1.0. We now accept only bug fixes to GPflow 1.0 in the **develop-1.0** branch. The latest available release is [v1.5.1](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/releases/tag/v1.5.1). [Documentation](https://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5.1-docs/) and [tutorials](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GPflow/GPflow/blob/develop/doc/source/notebooks/intro.ipynb) will remain available.*


## The GPflow Community

### Getting help

**Bugs, feature requests, pain points:**
Please use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/issues/) to flag up bugs/issues/pain points, suggest new features, and discuss anything else related to the use of GPflow that in some sense involves changing the GPflow code itself. Please make use of the labels such as `bug`, `discussion`, `feature`, etc.

We aim to respond to issues promptly, but if you believe we may have forgotten about an issue, please feel free to add another comment to remind us.

**How-to-use questions:**
Please use [StackOverflow (gpflow tag)](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/gpflow) to ask questions that relate to "how to use GPflow", i.e. questions of understanding rather than issues that require changing GPflow code.

### Slack workspace

We have a public [GPflow slack workspace](https://gpflow.slack.com/). Please use this [invite link](https://join.slack.com/t/gpflow/shared_invite/enQtOTE5MDA0Nzg5NjA2LTYwZWI3MzhjYjNlZWI1MWExYzZjMGNhOWIwZWMzMGY0YjVkYzAyYjQ4NjgzNDUyZTgyNzcwYjAyY2QzMWRmYjE) if you'd like to join, whether to ask short informal questions or to be involved in the discussion and future development of GPflow.

### Contributing

All constructive input is gratefully received. For more information, see the [notes for contributors](contributing.md).

## Compatibility

GPflow heavily depends on TensorFlow and as far as TensorFlow supports forward compatibility, GPflow should as well. The version of GPflow can give you a hint about backward compatibility. If the major version has changed then you need to check the release notes to find out how the API has been changed.

Unfortunately, there is no such thing as backward compatibility for GPflow _models_, which means that a model implementation can change without changing interfaces. In other words, the TensorFlow graph can be different for the same models from different versions of GPflow.
