    Multioutput Inducing Variables
    Base class for methods which define a collection of inducing variables which
    in some way can be grouped. The main example is where the inducing variables
    consist of outputs of various independent GPs. This can be because our model
    uses multiple independent GPs (SharedIndependent, SeparateIndependent) or
    because it is constructed from independent GPs (eg IndependentLatent,
    LinearCoregionalization).

    """
    Shared definition of inducing variables for each independent latent process.

    This class is designated to be used to
     - provide a general interface for multioutput kernels
       constructed from independent latent processes,
     - only require the specification of Kuu and Kuf.
    All multioutput kernels constructed from independent latent processes allow
    the inducing variables to be specified in the latent processes, and a
    reasonably efficient method (i.e. one that takes advantage of the
    independence in the latent processes) can be specified quite generally by
    only requiring the following covariances:
     - Kuu: [L, M, M],
     - Kuf: [L, M, N, P].
    In `gpflow/conditionals/multioutput/conditionals.py` we define a conditional() implementation for this
    combination. We specify this code path for all kernels which inherit from
    `IndependentLatentBase`. This set-up allows inference with any such kernel
    to be implemented by specifying only `Kuu()` and `Kuf()`.

    We call this the base class, since many multioutput GPs that are constructed
    from independent latent processes acutally allow even more efficient
    approximations. However, we include this code path, as it does not require
    specifying a new `conditional()` implementation.

    Here, we share the definition of inducing variables between all latent
    processes.
