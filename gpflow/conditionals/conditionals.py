    Single-output GP conditional.

    The covariance matrices used to calculate the conditional have the following shape:
    - Kuu: [M, M]
    - Kuf: [M, N]
    - Kff: [N, N]

    Parameters
    ----------
    :param Xnew: data matrix, size [N, D].
    :param f: data matrix, [M, R]
    :param full_cov: return the covariance between the datapoints
    :param full_output_cov: return the covariance between the outputs.
           NOTE: as we are using a single-output kernel with repetitions
                 these covariances will be zero.
    :param q_sqrt: matrix of standard-deviations or Cholesky matrices,
        size [M, R] or [R, M, M].
    :param white: boolean of whether to use the whitened representation
    :return:
        - mean:     [N, R]
        - variance: [N, R], [R, N, N], [N, R, R] or [N, R, N, R]
        Please see `gpflow.conditional._expand_independent_outputs` for more information
        about the shape of the variance, depending on `full_cov` and `full_output_cov`.

    Given f, representing the GP at the points X, produce the mean and
    (co-)variance of the GP at the points Xnew.

    Additionally, there may be Gaussian uncertainty about f as represented by
    q_sqrt. In this case `f` represents the mean of the distribution and
    q_sqrt the square-root of the covariance.

    Additionally, the GP may have been centered (whitened) so that
        p(v) = ùí©(ùüé, ùêà)
        f = ùêãv
    thus
        p(f) = ùí©(ùüé, ùêãùêã·µÄ) = ùí©(ùüé, ùêä).
    In this case `f` represents the values taken by v.

    The method can either return the diagonals of the covariance matrix for
    each output (default) or the full covariance matrix (full_cov=True).

    We assume R independent GPs, represented by the columns of f (and the
    first dimension of q_sqrt).
