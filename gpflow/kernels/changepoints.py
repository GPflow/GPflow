class ChangePoints(Combination):
    r"""
    The ChangePoints kernel defines a fixed number of change-points along a 1d
    input space where different kernels govern different parts of the space.

    The kernel is by multiplication and addition of the base kernels with
    sigmoid functions (σ). A single change-point kernel is defined as:

        K₁(x, x') * (1 - σ(x)) * (1 - σ(x')) + K₂(x, x') * σ(x) * σ(x')

    where K₁ is deactivated around the change-point and K₂ is activated. The
    single change-point version can be found in \citet{lloyd2014}. Each sigmoid
    is a logistic function defined as:

        σ(x) = 1 / (1 + exp{-s(x - x₀)})

    parameterized by location "x₀" and steepness "s".
