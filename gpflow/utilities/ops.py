    Transposes tensors with leading dimensions. Leading dimensions in
    permutation list represented via ellipsis `...` and is of type List[Union[int, type(...)]
    (please note, due to mypy issues, List[Any] is used instead).
    When leading dimensions are found, `transpose` method
    considers them as a single grouped element indexed by 0 in `perm` list. So, passing
    `perm=[-2, ..., -1]`, you assume that your input tensor has [..., A, B] shape,
    and you want to move leading dims between A and B dimensions.
    Dimension indices in permutation list can be negative or positive. Valid positive
    indices start from 1 up to the tensor rank, viewing leading dimensions `...` as zero
    index.

        a = tf.random.normal((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))

            # C is 3rd element in

            # leading dimensions are [1, 2, 3]
