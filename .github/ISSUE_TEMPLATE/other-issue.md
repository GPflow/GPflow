**GitHub issues are most helpful for reporting issues that may require changes to the GPflow code base itself. If your question is about how to *use* GPflow, please consider asking it on StackOverflow and using the `gpflow` tag (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gpflow) for your question.** This makes it easier for other users of GPflow to help you with your problem, and also makes your question and any answers more easily discoverable for others who may have the same question again in the future! If your question is about an omission or lack of clarity in the GPflow documentation, please use the documentation issue template.
