# Standard GPflow issue template

## Bug case

1. Describe a bug shortly - reasons and context.
2. Write down a testable minimal working example. We appreciate if you could not publish big snippets of code telling: "Houston, we have a problem". Your code must be copypast-able and the issue should be easily reproducible.
3. Sometimes extra information is required as well:
    * GPflow version or git commit (SHA hash) which you are using (e.g. `git rev-parse HEAD`)
    * Tensorflow version
    * Does your tensorflow use GPU or not
    * Python version
    * OS
    * PC, macbook configuration
