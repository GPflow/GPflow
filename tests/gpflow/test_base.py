def test_cast_to_dtype_precision_issue():
    """
    TensorFlow's tf.cast(value, dtype) implicitly does a tf.convert_to_tensor(value)
    *before* the cast when the value is not a tensor already. When value is a python float,
    this results in the following behaviour:

    >>> tf.cast(0.2, tf.float64)
    <tf.Tensor: id=37, shape=(), dtype=float64, numpy=0.20000000298023224>
    
    instead of the expected expansion of 0.2 to float64 precision that you get when
    passing in an object that already carries dtype information, such as a numpy array
    (which has float64 precision by default):

    >>> tf.cast(np.array(0.2), tf.float64)
    <tf.Tensor: id=40, shape=(), dtype=float64, numpy=0.2>

    This affected *all* gpflow.Parameter objects, resulting in numerical discrepancies
    between GPflow 1 and 2, due to the pass through _cast_to_dtype, which is now fixed.
    This is the corresponding regression test.
