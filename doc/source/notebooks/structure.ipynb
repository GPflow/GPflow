    "In this document I'll try to give some insight into what's happening under the hood in GPflow. First I'll explain how the hierarchical structure works: GPflow models, kernels, likelihoods and parameters are arranged in a tree. Next I'll attempt to explain what happens when we run `compile`, which builds a tensorflow graph ready for execution. Lots of these ideas are taken from GPy, where I was strongly influenced by Max Zwiesselle's work. You can find some of that in the [paramz project](http://github.com/sods/paramz)."

    "The tree is implicitely defined by the attributes of each class. To find all the child nodes of a node, we just search through the `__dict__` of the node, looking for `Parameterized` or `Param` objects. There's a built-in `sorted_params` property, which does this, and ensures that they always apear in the same order. A good example of a function that makes use of this is the `build_prior` function. In `Parameterized` this just calls `build_prior` on all the child nodes. In a `Param` object, this computes the log prior density, if applicable (else 0). Another good example that we'll see shortly is the `make_tf_array` function. "

    "All the elements of this tree inherrit from `Parentable`. This base class doesn't do much, apart from point 'up' the tree. Each element in the tree has a `_parent` attribute, which points at the member in the layer above. It's only possible to have one parent: this is a tree. The model (trunk) has a `None` parent. It's therefore possible to get a pointer to the trunk by recursing the `_parent` attribute, which is how we have defined `highest_parent`. This is used to tell the model if something has changed (like if a parameter has been swwitched to `fixed`)."

The current state of each parameter is stored as `self._array`; we have initialized each parameter with a guess. \n",
    "  - We store the data as `DataHolders`, which allows us to pass the data into `m.session`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. When we manually compile the model (`m.compile`), the models calls the build_likelihod function. But, in order to let us use the parameters and dataholders as a tensorflow object (see e.g. `tf.matmul(self.X, self.coeffs)`), this is done inside a python 'context' that we call `tf_mode`. Before we can use `tf_mode`, we must first call `make_tf_array`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `make_tf_array` takes the tensorflow placeholder `m._free_vars` and distributes it amongst the parameters. We go through all the parameters in turn, and take a chunk of `_free_vars` of the correct length, and reshape it (and possibly transform it, see later) into a tensorflow variable that can represent the parameter in the graph. In our simple example, `_free_vars` has length three. The first two elements are transformed into a 2x1 matrix of coeffs, and the last one is exponentiated to become the noise variance. Each Param object stores its transformed, reshaped section of `_free_vars` as `self._tf_array`. Similiarly, the DataHolder objects hold placeholders into which we later feed the data as `self._tf_array`. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inside the clause `with m.tf_mode()`, all of the parameters (and dataholders) are replaced with their `_tf_array` attributes. The `compile` function can then call the `build_likelhood` function which builds a representation of the likelihood as a function of `_free_vars` (via the `_tf_array` attributes). It also builds a convenient function `self._objective` which allows us to link up with scipy's `optimize` routines. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. The `_objective` function is a wrapper around a call to the model's `_session.run`. It calls `session.run()`, requesting the negative log_likelihood and the gradients with respect to `_free_vars`. Into the feed_dict, it passes the "
