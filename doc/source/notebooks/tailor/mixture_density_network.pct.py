# # Mixture Density Networks in GPflow
#
# In this notebook we explain how to implement a Mixture Density Network (MDN) [1] using GPflow. In theory, this is similar to [this blog post](http://blog.otoro.net/2015/11/24/mixture-density-networks-with-tensorflow/) from 2015, but instead of using TensorFlow directly we'll use GPflow. GPflow is typically used for building Gaussian Process-based models, but the framework contains many useful methods and classes that can be used to quickly prototype a wide variety of ML algorithms. Excellent for doing research!
#
# We start by explaining why MDNs can be useful. We then examine a GPflow implementation of the model and use it for a couple of toy experiments.

# ## Conditional Density Estimation models
# Imagine we are interested in performing regression on the following dataset.

# %%
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# %matplotlib inline

CMAP = plt.get_cmap('Blues')

# %%
N = 200
NOISE_STD = 5.0e-2

def sinusoidal_data(N, noise):
    Y = np.linspace(-2, 2, N)[:, None]
    X = np.sin(4 * Y) * 2.0 + Y * 0.5
    X += np.random.randn(N, 1) * noise
    Y += np.random.randn(N, 1) * noise
    return X, Y

X, Y = data = sinusoidal_data(N, NOISE_STD)

plt.plot(X, Y,'ro', alpha=0.3);
plt.xlabel("$x$");
plt.ylabel("$y$");

# %% [markdown]
# At first sight, this dataset doesn't seem overly complex. Both input and output have a single dimension, and the data has a clear sinusoidal pattern. However, notice that a single input $x$ can correspond to multiple output values $y$, so for example $x=0$ can yield any of the values $\{-1.5, -3/4, 0, 0.8, 1.5\}$. Typical regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Gaussian Process regression and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) struggle as they can only predict one output value for every input.
#
# To model this dataset we can use a Conditional Density Estimation (CDE) model. CDE models infer $p(f(x)|x)$ instead of just calculating the expectation $E[f(x) | x]$. Modeling the complete distribution $p(f(x)|x)$ is typically harder but it reveals more interesting properties, such as the modes, outlier boundaries and samples. A real-world example might be modeling taxi drop-offs, conditioned on the pick-up location. We would expect a taxi drop-off location to be multi-modal as passengers need to go to different destinations (airport/city center/suburbs and so on) and the density depends on the starting location [2].

# ## Mixture Density Network models
#
# Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a parametric class of models that allow for conditional density estimation. They consist of two parts: a neural net and a Mixture of Gaussians (MoG). The neural net is responsible for producing the characteristics of the MoG. In practice, given that the MoG consists of $M$ Gaussians, the neural net will output a collection of $M$ means, variances and weights $\{\mu_m, \sigma_m^2, \pi_m\}_{m=1}^M$. These means, variances and weights are used to define the conditional probability distribution function: 
# $$
# p(Y = y\,|\,X = x) = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \pi_{m}(x)\,\mathcal{N}\big(y\, \left|\,\mu_{m}(x), \sigma_{m}^2(x)\big)\right.
# $$
#
# Each of the parameters  $\pi_{m}(x), \mu_{m}(x), \sigma_{m}(x)$ of the distribution are determined by the neural net, as a function of the input $x$.
#
# We train the MDN's neural net by optimizing the model's likelihood:
# $$
# \mathcal{L} \triangleq \text{argmax}_{\Theta} \prod_{n=1}^N p(Y = y_n | X = x_n)
# $$
#
# where $\Theta$ collects the neural net's weights and biases and $\{x_n, y_n\}_{n=1}^N$ represents our training dataset.

# ## A GPflow MDN implementation
#
# GPflow doesn't reinvent the wheel; most of what follows is just plain Python/TensorFlow code. We choose to use GPflow, however, because it provides us with functionality to easily define a model. Once we have a GPflow model, we can specify its objective function, parameters and dataset. This extra layer of abstraction makes interacting with the model much easier, for example optimizing or performing inference. 
#
# We begin by importing the required packages from TensorFlow and GPflow.

# %%
import tensorflow as tf

# %%
import gpflow
from gpflow.models import BayesianModel
from gpflow.base import Parameter

# %% [markdown]
# Next, we create a `MDN` class that inherits from GPflow's `Model` class. We need to do the following:
# 1. Store each of the feature and target matrices (X, Y) as a `DataHolder` object.
# 2. Define our model's parameters using GPflow's `Parameter` and `ParamList` objects.
# 3. Define the objective function using the `_build_likelihood` method. When we optimize the model the negative of this function will be minimized.

# ### Notes
# - Given we are dealing with a MoG, the neural net output must comply with the following restrictions:
# $$
# \sum_{m=1}^{M} \pi_{m}(x) = 1, \pi_m \ge 0\ \text{and}\ \sigma_m\ \forall\ m
# $$
# We achieve this by applying the `softmax` operator to the $\pi$'s and by taking the `exp` to the $\sigma$'s.
#
# - We use the "Xavier" initialization for the neural net's weights. (Glorot and Bengio, 2010).
#
# - Instead of calculating the pdf of the Gaussians, we work with the pdf `log` and use `tf.reduce_logsumexp`. This is mainly for numerical stability.

# ## Experiment 1: The sinusoidal dataset
#
# Let's see how our model works in practice with the sinusoidal dataset presented earlier. We do this by initializing a new instance of our MDN model, and then specifying the dataset $(X, Y)$, the number of hidden units of the MDN's neural net, and the number of mixture components $M$.

# The objective function for MDN instances is the `log_marginal_likelihood`, which we use for optimization of the parameters. GPflow ensures that only the variables stored in `Parameter` objects are optimized. For the MDN, the only parameters are the weights and the biases of the neural net.
#
# We use the `Scipy` optimizer, which is a wrapper around SciPy's L-BFGS optimization algorithm. Note that GPflow supports other TensorFlow optimizers such as `Adam`, `Adagrad`, and `Adadelta` as well.

# %%
from gpflow.optimizers import Scipy
from gpflow.ci_utils import ci_niter

Scipy().minimize(
    tf.function(lambda: - model.log_marginal_likelihood(data)),
    variables=model.trainable_parameters,
    options=dict(maxiter=ci_niter(1500))
);

print("Final Likelihood", model.log_marginal_likelihood(data).numpy())

# %% [markdown]
# To evaluate the validity of our model, we draw the posterior density. We also plot $\mu(x)$ of the optimized neural net. Remember that for every $x$ the neural net outputs $M$ means $\mu_m(x)$. These determine the location of the Gaussians. We plot all $M$ means and use their corresponding mixture weight $\pi_m(X)$ to determine their size. Larger dots will have more impact in the Gaussian ensemble.
