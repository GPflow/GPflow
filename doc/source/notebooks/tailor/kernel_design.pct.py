# # Kernel Design
#
# It's easy to make new kernels in GPflow. To demonstrate, we'll have a look at the Brownian motion kernel, whose function is 
# $$
# k(x, x') = \sigma^2 \text{min}(x, x')
# $$
# where $\sigma^2$ is a variance parameter.

# To make this new kernel class, we inherit from the base class `gpflow.kernels.Kernel` and implement the three functions below. **NOTE:** Depending on the kernel to be implemented, other classes can be more adequate. For example, if the kernel to be implemented is stationary, you can immediately subclass `gpflow.kernels.Stationary` (at which point you 
# only have to override `K_r` or `K_r2`; see the `Stationary` class docstring).
#
# #### `__init__`
# In this simple example, the constructor takes no argument (though it could, if that was convenient, for example to pass in an initial value for `variance`). It *must* call the constructor of the superclass with appropriate arguments. Brownian motion is only defined in one dimension, and we'll assume that the `active_dims` are `[0]`, for simplicity.
#
# We've added a parameter to the kernel using the `Parameter` class. Using this class lets the parameter be used in computing the kernel function, and it will automatically be recognised for optimization (or MCMC). Here, the variance parameter is initialized at 1, and constrained to be positive. 
#
# #### `K`
# This is where you implement the kernel function itself. This takes two arguments, `X` and `X2`. By convention, we make the second argument optional (it defaults to `None`). 
#
# Inside `K`, all the computation must be done with TensorFlow - here we've used `tf.minimum`. When GPflow executes the `K` function, `X` and `X2` will be TensorFlow tensors, and parameters such as `self.variance` behave like TensorFlow tensors as well.
#
# #### `K_diag`
# This convenience function allows GPflow to save memory at predict time. It's simply the diagonal of the `K` function, in the case where `X2` is `None`. It must return a one-dimensional vector, so we use TensorFlow's reshape command.

    ax.set_title('Samples ' + k.__class__.__name__)

    xx = np.linspace(xmin, xmax, 100)[:,None]

# ## Using the kernel in a model
#
# Because we've inherited from the `Kernel` base class, this new kernel has all the properties needed to be used in GPflow. It also has some convenience features such as allowing the user to call
#
# `k(X, X2)`
#
# which computes the kernel matrix.
#
# To show that this kernel works, let's use it inside GP regression. We'll see that Brownian motion has quite interesting properties. To add a little flexibility, we'll add a `Constant` kernel to our `Brownian` kernel, and the `GPR` class will handle the noise.
