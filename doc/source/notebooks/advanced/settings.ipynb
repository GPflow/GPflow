    "# Settings and GPflow config\n",
    "GPflow has a config file, `gpflowrc` which allows the user to change the default behavious in GPflow. GPflow searches for the file in the following order:\n",
    "1. In the working directory\n",
    "2. In the user's home directory\n",
    "3. In the GPflow directory (revert to default)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also make `gpflowrc` a hidden file, if you don't want it clutting your home directory, by renaming as `.gpflowrc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, one wants to change the settings for an entire project. We recommend adding a `gpflowrc` file in the working directory to achieve this effect. It is helpful to add assertions / warnings in code to ensure that the correct settings are used. GPflow also allows settings to be adjusted in code, although this comes with some additional difficulties (see below). This is why we recommend using a settings file."

    "## Common uses\n",
    "The most common use cases for changing settings are:\n",
    "- **Jitter levels**: GPflow has to perform Cholesky decompositions to learn GPs, which require positive definite (PSD) matrices. Due to the numerical behaviour of floating point numbers, kernel matrices may behave as though they are not exactly PSD. To avoid errors regarding to positive definiteness or invertibility, we add *jitter* to a matrix that is to be inverted, i.e. we perform $\\mathrm{Cholesky}\\left(K + jI\\right)$.\n",
    "- **Floating point precision**: We can adjust the precision at which computations get performed to take advantage of e.g. faster `float32` computations on the GPU."
