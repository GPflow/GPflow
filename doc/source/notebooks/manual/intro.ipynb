    "This document can be used to get familiarised with GPflow. We've split up the material in four different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "The basics notebooks cover the elementairy uses of GPflow, where we show how to use GPflow for your basic datasets with existing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - In [regression.ipynb](basics/regression.ipynb) and [classification.ipynb](basics/classification.ipynb) we show how to use GPflow to fit a simple regression and classification models (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006)\n",
    "  - In [gplvm.ipynb](basics/GPLVM.ipynb) we cover the unsupervised case, and showcase GPflow's Bayesian GPLVM implementation (Titsias and Lawrence, 2010).\n",
    "  - When you're dealing with a large datasets (over 1k), you want to resort to Sparse methods. In [GPs for big data.ipynb](basics/many_points.ipynb)  we show how to use GPflow's Sparse Variational GP (SVGP) model (Hensman et al., 2013; 2015)\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these notebooks we go over the data format, model setup, model optimisation and predict options.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "This section covers the building blocks of GPflow from a implementation perspective, and show how the different modules interact as a whole.\n",
    "  - [Architecture](understanding/architecture.ipynb)  **[TODO]**\n",
    "  - [Utilities](understanding/utilities.ipynb): expectations, multi-output, conditionals, kullbach leibers (KL), log-densities, features and quadrature  **[TODO]**\n",
    "  - [Manipulating models](understanding/models.ipynb)  **[TODO]**\n",
    "  - [Handling TensorFlow graph and sessions](understanding/tf_graphs_and_sessions.ipynb)  **[TODO]**\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Advanced Needs\n",
    "\n",
    "GPflow also allows for more complex features and models:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Models:*\n",
    "  - [MCMC](advanced/mcmc.ipynb)  **[TODO]**\n",
    "  - [ordinal regression](advanced/ordinal_regression.ipynb)\n",
    "  - [multi-class classification](advanced/multiclass_classification.ipynb)\n",
    "  - [multi-outputs and coregionalisation](advanced/multioutputs_and_coregionalisation.ipynb)  **[TODO]**\n",
    "    - [multi-outputs and coregionalisation](advanced/multioutputs_and_coregionalisation.ipynb)  **[TODO]**\n",
    "  - [advanced many-points](advanced/advanced_many_points.ipynb)  **[TODO]**\n",
    "  - [Manipulating kernels](advanced/kernels.ipynb) shows what covariances are included in the library, and how they can be combined to create new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Features:*\n",
    "  - [natural gradients](advanced/natural_gradients.ipynb)\n",
    "  - [optimisers](advanced/optimisation.ipynb)  **[TODO]**\n",
    "  - [settings](advanced/settings.ipynb): Adjust jitter (for inversion or Cholesky errors), floating point precision, parallelism, and more.\n",
    "  - [Monitoring parameter optimisations](advanced/monitoring.ipynb): Sending things to TensorBoard, (re)storing checkpoints, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tailored models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we show how GPflow's utilities and codebase can be used to build new probabilistic models.\n",
    "These can be seen as complete examples.\n",
    "  - [kernel design](tailor/kernel_design.ipynb) Shows how to implement a covariance function that is not available by default in GPflow. For this example, we looked at the Brownian motion covariance.\n",
    "  - [likelihood design](tailor/likelihood_design.ipynb) **[TODO]**\n",
    "  - [Latent variable models](tailor/models_with_latent_variables.ipynb) **[TODO]**\n",
    "  - [Updating models with new data](tailor/updating_models_with_new_data.ipynb) **[TODO]**\n",
    "  - [External mean functions](tailor/external_mean_functions.ipynb) **[TODO]**\n",
    "  - [mixture density network](tailor/mixture_density_network.ipynb) **[TODO]**\n",
