==================
Kernels included in GPflow
==================

Kernels form a core component of GPflow models and allow prior information to be encoded about a latent function of interest. A notebook showing the effect of choosing different kernels, and showing how it is possible to combine multiple kernels can be found in the `tutorials <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GPflow/GPflow/blob/develop-1.0/doc/source/notebooks/advanced/kernels.ipynb>`_.
